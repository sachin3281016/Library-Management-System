Creating a README file that provides guidance on how to run a Spring Boot and React.js project is a great way to help users get started with your project. Below is an example of how you can structure your README file to include instructions on how to pull the repository, install dependencies, and run the Spring Boot and React.js projects.

```markdown

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (optional, if not bundled with your IDE)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sachin3281016/Library-Management-System.git
   cd Library-Management-System
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Spring Boot)**:

   Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd 01-BACKEND/spring-boot-library
   ```

   If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can import the project as a Maven project. Maven will automatically download all the required dependencies.

   Alternatively, you can use the following command to ensure all dependencies are downloaded:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup (React.js)**:

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd ../../02-FRONTEND/react-library
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Backend**:

   Navigate to the backend directory if you aren't already there:

   ```bash
   cd 01-BACKEND/spring-boot-library
   ```

   Run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Run the Frontend**:

   Navigate to the frontend directory if you aren't already there:

   ```bash
   cd ../../02-FRONTEND/react-library
   ```

   Start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Project Structure

### Additional Tips

- **Ensure your README is up-to-date**: Regularly update your README file to reflect any changes in the project structure or setup instructions.
- **Use Markdown for Formatting**: Markdown makes your README file easy to read and navigate. Use headings, lists, code blocks, and links to organize the content effectively.

By following the above template, you can provide clear and concise instructions to users on how to set up and run your Spring Boot and React.js project.
